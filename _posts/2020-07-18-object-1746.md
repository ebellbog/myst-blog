In the vault of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) sits one of the only video games ever inducted into the museum's hallowed permanent collection. *Myst*, a stack of five shiny CD-Rom discs, sits alongside works by Matisse, Picasso and Van Gogh. *Myst* and *Starry Night* are neighbors, and deservedly so. If you ever played it, you know what I mean, and you got goose bumps because you just heard that music in your head, and you want to figure out how to get inside that spaceship. You can't help it, it calls to you... The music just picked up pace, and you know you're on the right path...

After 30 years of editing, writing, directing and producing a whole lotta award winning documentaries for theaters and television, this is the first movie that I am creating on my own from its very inception. I'm a little nervous, but very excited. 

The flood of messages in support of this project has been incredible.

Everything you supporters do shows other people that this is a film worth making, so to those of you who have reached out to me: thank you, thank you, thank you. Keep those cards & letters coming, folks! I am replying to every one of them as fast as possible, with deep gratitude.

Tell your friends, and dare them to try to get something even cooler than you! There are lots of really awesome, inspiring rewards for you to choose from at many gift levels, including the gift of receiving a copy of the film itself when it's finished and knowing that you played an important role in bringing it to life, with your own hands.

Thank you for supporting the arts, and especially independent cinema. 

The power of movie magic is in your hand... which floats before you... pointing the way... waiting for you to  <i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> [click](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/philipshane/the-myst-documentary?ref=do7fc5)!
