Documentary filmmaker Philip Shane has made films about famous people before – Albert Einstein, in his biography for the History Channel; the man behind the beloved muppet character, Elmo, in *Being Elmo: A Puppeteer’s Journey*; even Paul McCartney for the post-Beatles TV doc, *Wingspan*. But one of his greatest thrills was meeting two brothers – Rand and Robyn Miller – who were responsible for one of his all-time favorite video-game universes: the *Myst* franchise.

Philip played *Myst* in his undergrad years at the University of Maryland and fell in love with the game’s mystique and style. As a young nerd, nerding his way through college, the idea that he could meet the Miller Brothers seemed as absurd a possibility as bumping into any of his other heroes, like George Lucas or Steven Spielberg. The latter were in Hollywood, and the former were in a town called “Spokane,” each place, a far off land. Twenty years later, after becoming a noted documentary filmmaker living in Brooklyn, he saw a piece on Twitter about a video-game conference called the “Kill Screen Festival” that was to take place in April of that year, 2016, featuring Robyn and Rand as keynote speakers.

From the very first humble answers given by the Millers at “Kill Screen,” Philip said he could tell there were some great stories behind the making of the game that no one had heard before. He also discovered he was not alone being a passionate *Myst* fan. “Twenty-five years after *Myst* came out, fans were still dressing up as characters,” Philip said. “There’s an annual convention, and fans give Rand & Robyn crafts they had made. There’s a really devoted fan community.”

The Millers themselves continue to be bowled over about how their game still touches people to this day. “It doesn’t matter when or where – it’s by far the most rewarding aspect of the entire thing,” they said. At the festival, Philip introduced himself and was charmed to learn that both Rand and Robyn had seen some of the movies he had done, including *Being Elmo*. While he was listening to the brothers speak with such humility and gratitude about their lives, their success, and the fans, Philip realized, “This is it! I must make this documentary.”

He asked Rand and Robyn if anyone had made a film about the making of *Myst* and their story of coming from nowhere and inventing the most popular game for years, and they said no. Philip asked, “Could I do it?” After a surprised pause, they immediately said yes. “I’ve never had a project greenlit that fast,” Philip added.

Philip now had a subject and a story, but he needed some kind of structure to drive the narrative forward. Turns out the Millers were just finishing a game, to be called *Obduction*, which prompted Philip to bring his Director of Photography, Kyle Kelley, with him to visit Cyan headquarters in Spokane to film the completion of that game.

Production began in Spokane that summer, filming the frenzy of the programmers and artists at Cyan pushing toward the deadline of the release of *Obduction* in August 2016, With Rand in Spokane, and Robyn creating the musical score in Seattle. “As a filmmaker, you learn to develop a gut feeling for when you find a really sharp story,” he said. “It’s also fascinating to be behind the scenes of artists at a company where ideas get started and things develop, change and shift.”

Now you can be part of the team behind Philip as he continues editing footage and conducting interviews with Robyn, Rand and other games at Cyan in Spokane, Seattle and Silicon Valley. Donate whatever you can now and help Philip bring this untold story to vibrant life!
