The name of my production company is "Glorious Nerds." It's one of my favorite phrases, and it was coined by William Cavendish, the discoverer of the atom. Actually, Will didn't discover the atom, but he IS a glorious nerd and he is one of the many incredible people who is helping bring this movie to life. 

Also on board this wondrous ship is Randy Woods. Randy and I have been making films together for forty years, with a gap of about 30 years since I moved to New York and because there was Zoom. We also have Khatie Postma on board, and she is as glorious a nerd as ever sailed upon the wine dark sea. And there's Iuliana, and Elana, and Josh and Ben and Blake and Adam and Chris and Jay and nary a jock or a dweeb among them!

But we geeks, we happy geeks, do not live on this world alone. And we have sometimes been treated with, how to put this delicately... well, you fill in the word. Sometimes people just don't understand, ya know? They don't get us. Yes, geeks have risen in stature mightily since they dank dark days of the Geek Squad. We were elevated to Geniuses, yes!, but still they put us behind bars. 

For many, many, many (many) glorious hours we have lived in other worlds, where things are simpler, or more complex, kinder, or more terrifying, welcoming, or daunting. We listen to the wind. We watch the Sunners bathing. We stand in the scrolling shadow of the windmill, listening to the bubbling plumbing at our feet. We fearlessly ride broken elevators, screeching runaway mine carts, beeping banging buzzing yellow submarines stuck in a railway maze, SPACESHIPS WITH PIANOS!!! 

If you are completely confused at this point, totally confounded, eyes glazing over with the endless onslaught of exclamation marks... THIS FILM IS FOR YOU.

Huh? Isn't it obviously a love note from one fan to other fans? The nerds can nerd out! The geeks can geek out! (See, this is why there are no dweebs here, because you can't "dweeb out.") Well, yes! BUT...

I began my career in documentaries with a very clear mission in mind. Thirty-three years ago, I was an engineering intern at NASA's Goddard Space Center. I was geek incarnate! Except for one thing: I hated math. And so, after four years at NASA, and realizing I wouldn't be traveling to space or even to the next level of government employment, I changed my major at the University of Maryland and became a filmmaker. And I chose to be a documentary filmmaker. I figured if I could not be a true geek, I WOULD TELL THEIR TALES.

Like many who have traveled across borders, I could speak two languages: Geek and Norm. (I think Geek and Nerd are separate dialects of, if you'll allow me, the same tongue. Again, I do not speak dweeb, for dweebs do not speak without shrieking.) I'm kidding here, but not kidding. I am, as one very nerdy nerd once put it so well: "kidding on the square." I truly believe that my quest is to translate what is in the minds and hearts of one kind of people, using the language of movies, into a universal language of compassion and humanity. Cinema is my Esperanto, if you will. (I'm insanely deep-in-nerd here, but I think I'm in a safe space with you.)

And thus we have come to the fork in the road, my fellow traveler. (As Randy knows, I attended "Robert Frost Junior High School" and so we have a particular affinity for forks in the road.) To the right is a well vacuumed road along which Teslas fly silently in the breeze, auto piloting to and from ComicCon. To the left, a path so over grown as to be barely visible at all, thick with brush and crooked roots and... DANGER. In fact, the danger is hardly subtle. There are literally signs that say DANGER. And across these metal sentinels is scrawled in spray paint: No Geeks. Kool Dudez Only!

And here we find a scroll, under the brush, wrapped in roots. We pull it out, unscroll it wide and (rolling a 20-sided die, yes, ok!) we can read it. The message is to bring the love of geek, and nerd (but not dweeb) to the Norms. To the world. To the moms and dads, and brothers and sisters, and people on the bus and people on bikes and everyone everywhere. Let them experience the world as we do. Let them relish columns of DATA. Let them treasure the gift of a half burned book! Let them hear the wind in their ears as they thrill to the aligning of a microphone with a radio dish as the sun sets behind pillars of polygons!

In short: movies have many magic powers, and one of the most magical, the most powerful, the most transformative, is to connect us to people we do not understand. There are some in this world who don't like sweating the details, who don't like puzzling the puzzles, who have no patience for exploration or stillness or quiet wonder. 

But they can. Through movies like this, they can. The Miller brothers are living an incredibly storied and wonderful life. Not an easy life, creativity is not easy, not easy on the family, not easy on the pocket book, not easy on the mind, not easy on the soul. But this is true of you, too. Perhaps a little more of this, a little less of that, but life is a puzzle and the Ages are literal. Movies help us relate to each other, to admire each other, to understand each other, to, perhaps, love each other.

Myst is taught in schools all over the world as a transformative work of technology and art and design and immersive entertainment. It foresaw much about our modern technology that is only now coming into being, and it is still playing a part in what is to come. The faculty and students in all these schools of design, engineering, computer science, and even wonder of wonders: video gaming (!) would understand the importance of this film and would love it as viewers, and would be able to use it to share their love for their craft, and to help inspire ever more generations to create great games and thrilling art.

Myst resides in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, as do, amazingly enough, quite a few video games now! We have been speaking with curators who have created exhibits like one of the most influential gaming exhibits ever, at the Smithsonian Institution. People who support museums that support modern art and design, or who manage them, or who simply (like me!) attend them, would love to see this film come to life.

_**And there are other circles of people who would enjoy this project, and you can help them learn about it.**_

Share your ideas with us, and even better, share them widely with your own communities. Email, tweet, share, scribe, scroll, chisel, all that. 

Let's be nerds and make spreadsheets (we've been doing that) and writing applescripts and macros (yep, doing that, too) and we're not too proud to Google, or maybe even Bing (hey, you be you). 

_**Lastly, and this is my favorite one:**_

An extraordinary amount of Myst fans became fans because they played the game with their family. Sometimes just a sibling, sometimes just one parent, sometimes the whole family, sometimes with grandparents! My sister played Myst, and as far as I know, it's the only video game she ever played (I will find out, it might be in the film!). And, let's face it, a lot of these family members aren't on Twitter, or even Facebook, and Insta-what?

Give 'em a call if you think they'd enjoy knowing that game you played while sitting on their lap is still so meaningful to you that you are teaming up with others -- who love it as much as you do -- and as much they do -- and we're all going to make a movie about it.

_**Thanks for geeking out with me.**_ Thanks for humming nerd with me. No dweebs were harmed in this movie.
